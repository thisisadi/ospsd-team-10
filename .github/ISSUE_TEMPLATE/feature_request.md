- [ ] Configuration / Authentication (`S3Config`, env vars)
- [ ] Dependency Injection / Factory registration
- [ ] New component (specify name)
- [ ] Testing infrastructure
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Project tooling/configuration

## Proposed Solution

### Feature Description

Detailed description of the proposed feature:

### API Design (if applicable)

```python
# Show how the new feature would be used
from cloud_storage_client_api.client import get_client

client = get_client()
# Example of new functionality
client.upload_object("my-bucket", "example.txt", b"hello")
result = client.new_feature_method(parameters)
```

### Component Architecture Impact

#### New Contracts/Interfaces

- [ ] Requires new contract definition
- [ ] Extends existing contract
- [ ] No contract changes needed

#### Implementation Strategy

- [ ] Add to existing component
- [ ] Create new component
- [ ] Modify multiple components
- [ ] Requires breaking changes

#### Dependency Injection

- [ ] Uses existing injection / factory pattern
- [ ] Requires new injection mechanism or factory registration
- [ ] No injection changes needed

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Complexity

- [ ] **Simple** - Straightforward addition, minimal code changes
- [ ] **Moderate** - Requires some design work, multiple file changes
- [ ] **Complex** - Significant architectural changes, extensive testing needed
- [ ] **Major** - Large feature requiring substantial design and implementation

### Compatibility Impact

- [ ] **Backward Compatible** - No breaking changes
- [ ] **Requires Migration** - Breaking changes with migration path
- [ ] **Breaking Change** - Incompatible with current versions

### Performance Impact

- [ ] **No impact** - Feature doesn't affect performance
- [ ] **Positive impact** - Feature improves performance
- [ ] **Minimal impact** - Slight performance cost acceptable
- [ ] **Significant impact** - Requires performance optimization

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies

List any new external dependencies this feature would require:

-

### Version Compatibility

- **Python:** Minimum version required
- **Dependencies:** Any version constraints
- **APIs:** External API version requirements (e.g., AWS SDK / boto3)

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Impact

- [ ] No authentication changes
- [ ] Requires new AWS IAM permissions or S3 bucket policies
- [ ] Changes `S3Config` or credential handling
- [ ] Affects token or key management

### Data Security

- [ ] No sensitive data involved
- [ ] Handles sensitive data securely
- [ ] Requires data encryption (in transit or at rest)
- [ ] Affects data storage or retention

### API Security

- [ ] No new API endpoints
- [ ] Secure API communication
- [ ] Input validation required
- [ ] Rate limiting considerations

## Examples and Mockups

### Code Examples

```python
# Example 1: Basic usage
from cloud_storage_client_api.client import get_client

client = get_client()
client.new_feature_method("my-bucket", "example.txt")
```

```python
# Example 2: Advanced usage
from cloud_storage_client_api.client import get_client

client = get_client()
advanced_result = client.advanced_feature(
    bucket="my-bucket",
    key="path/to/object",
    param1="value1",
    param2="value2"
)
```

### Configuration Examples

```toml
# pyproject.toml changes (if applicable)
[tool.new_feature]
setting1 = "value1"
setting2 = true
```
